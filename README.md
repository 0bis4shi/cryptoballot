CryptoBallot
============

CryptoBallot is a cryptographically secure decentralized E2E voting system meant for real-world elections. It is a "backend" service providing vote storage, cryptographic operations, and an API. It does not provide a user interface.

It uses  Shamir Secret Sharing for election decryption keys, blind-signing for voter anonymity, and an optional blockchain backend for distributed transaction storage and verification.  It supports all tally methods including write-in candidates. 

## Goals

1. **Verifiable** - the entire voting process should be end-to-end verifiable.
2. **Ergonomic** - Easy to use.
3. **Fast** - 1,000 votes per second.
4. **Scalable** - Millions of voters.
5. **Secure** - Rock solid security guaruntees.

## Current State

Under active development. Not ready for production use!

| âš        | Support all tally methods         | Uses [Tallystick](https://github.com/phayes/tallystick)        |

|         | Distributed key generation        | Replace Shamir, uses ElGamal, fully verifiable and distributed |
|         | Onion mixnet (likely Sphinx)      | Strengthened voter anonymity - Depends on REST frontend        |
|         | Re-encryption mixnet              | Strengthened voter anonymity - far future if ever              |
